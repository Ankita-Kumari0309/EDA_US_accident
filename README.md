Exploratory_Data_Analysis_US_Accident 🚗


Project Description 📊

The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset of US car accidents. By analyzing various attributes such as state, city, time, and geographic coordinates, we aim to derive valuable insights into accident patterns and trends. This analysis will support decision-making in safety measures, resource allocation, and traffic management.


🎯 Objectives

Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "US Accidents (2016 - 2023)" dataset aims to accomplish the following:

1. Analyze Accident Trends by State: Identify the states with the highest accident rates.

2. Explore City-Level Data: Determine which cities report the highest number of accidents.

3. Examine Temporal Patterns: Investigate how accidents are distributed by day of the week, month, and time of day.

4. Geographic Analysis: Explore the geographic distribution of accidents using latitude and longitude.

5. Yearly Trends: Analyze how accident numbers have changed over the years.

In order to do this, we will use Python libraries like folium, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, which will help us carry out a thorough exploratory data analysis.


💻 Technologies Used 


1. Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy

2. Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

3. Data Handling: Jupyter Notebook


🔑 Key Insights 


1. More Accidents in Winter: The dataset shows that there are more accidents during the winter months compared to warmer months.

2. States with Highest Number of Accidents: California, Florida, and Texas have the highest number of reported accidents.

3. Cities with Highest Number of Accidents: Miami and Houston have the most accident reports.

4. Accidents by Day of the Week: Thursdays and Wednesdays see more accidents compared to other weekdays.

5. Monthly Trends: The number of accidents decreases from January to June and then increases from July to December.

6. Yearly Trend: The number of accidents increased from 2016 to 2021 but started to decrease after 2021.

7. Accidents by Time of Day: The highest number of accidents occur between 6 AM to 10 AM and around 3 PM to 6 PM.

8. Hourly Distribution: On weekends, accidents are lower, while more accidents occur on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

9. Cities with Single Accident: There are a total of 1,023 cities where only one accident was reported.


📝 Steps to Perform :


1. Search and collected the datasets

2. Load and Read the Dataset.
   
3. Analyze the Columns and Rows of the Dataset
 
4. Start Performing EDA
  
5. Plot the Graphs to Show the result.
    
6. Summarize the result.


🏁 Conclusion 

This EDA provides a comprehensive overview of accident patterns across different states, cities, times, and locations. These insights are crucial for understanding high-risk areas and times, and for improving safety measures and resource allocation.
